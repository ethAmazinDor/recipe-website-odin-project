        <h3 id="food-desc">Plump gnocchi, ground beef, and tender zucchini get a delicious kick from Calabrian chile
            paste, a specialty ingredient
            from southern Italy known for its irresistibly sweet-hot flavor. We’re finishing it all with a bit of
            mascarpone cheese,
            which balances out the heat and provides creamy texture.</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir
                in crushed
                tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
                seasoning, 1 teaspoon
                salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
                minutes. Drain
                noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
                parsley, and 1/2
                teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
                lengthwise over
                meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese
                slices. Spoon 1
                1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top
                with remaining
                mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
                spray, or make sure
                the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15
                minutes before
                serving.</li>
        </ol>
