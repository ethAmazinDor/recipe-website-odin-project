        <h3 id="food-desc">As you can see from the picture, you don't need to use penne. In fact, we prefer the fatter
            rigatoni tubes because the
            middles catch more sauce. Rigatoni alla vodka just doesn't have the same ring to it, ya know?

            While this pasta is certainly delicious on its own, it also lends itself to add-ins to make it extra hearty
            and boost
            flavor.</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently,
                until softened,
                4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until paste has coated shallots
                and garlic and is
                beginning to darken, 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add vodka to pot and stir to incorporate, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Turn
                off heat.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. Reserve 2 cups of pasta water
                before
                draining.</li>
            <li>Return sauce to medium heat and add 1/4 cup of pasta water and heavy cream, stirring to combine. Add
                half the Parmesan
                and stir until melted. Turn off heat and stir in cooked pasta. Fold in remaining Parmesan, adding more
                pasta water
                (about a tablespoon at a time) if the sauce is looking dry. Season with salt if needed. Serve topped
                with more Parmesan
                and torn basil leaves.</li>

        </ol>
